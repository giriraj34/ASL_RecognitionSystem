CSE 572 Spring 2018 Group 12 

Instructions on running code:

Copy the Data folder into the folder where you place Matlab codes and also create a output folder. Create a folder named EigenVectors.

We are considering only DM02, DM03, DM04, DM05, and DM12 data.

We have one Matlab code for each action. Open the required Matlab file and click on Run. Two figures will be generated. One for Feature extraction and one for plotting data points in the 3D latent feature space. One excel will generated for each action with the Eigen vectors. We use this excel to plot the Eugene vectors using Spider Plot.

"code" folder contains all the code files.
"graphs" folder contains all the relevant graphs for the project.
