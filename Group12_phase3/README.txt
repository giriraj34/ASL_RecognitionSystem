CSE 572 Spring 2018 Group 12 

Instructions on running code:

Copy the Data folder(CSE572_A2_data) into the folder previous to code floder and also create a output2 folder. Create a file named 'performance.xlsx'.

We are considering only 10 users data - DM02, DM03, DM04, DM05, DM06, DM07, DM08, DM09, DM10 and DM12.

We have one Matlab code for each action. Open the required Matlab file and click on Run. Four figures will be generated. First for Decision tree, second for svm, third for confusion matrix of Neural network and last one for ROC of neural network. One excel sheet will generated for each action with the performance statistics of the different classification algorithms.

Content:
"code" folder contains all the code files.
"graphs" folder contains all the relevant graphs for the project.
"README.txt" file
"REPORT.pdf"
"performance.xlsx" - file containing performance analysis of 10 users.
