CSE 572 Spring 2018 Group 12 

Instructions on running code:

Copy the Data folder(CSE572_A2_data) into the folder previous to code floder and also create a output2 folder. Create a file named 'performance.xlsx'.

We are considering only 10 users data for training - DM01, DM02, DM03, DM04, DM05, DM06, DM07, DM08, DM09 and DM10.

We have one Matlab code for each action. Open the required Matlab file and click on Run. Four figures will be generated. First for Decision tree, second for svm, third for confusion matrix of Neural network and last one for ROC of neural network. One excel sheet will generated for each action with the performance statistics of the different classification algorithms.

Content:
"code" folder contains all the code files.
"README.txt" file
"REPORT.pdf"
"performance.xlsx" - file containing performance analysis of 27 users.
